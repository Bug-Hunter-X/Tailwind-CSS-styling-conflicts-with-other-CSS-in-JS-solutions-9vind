# Tailwind CSS Styling Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS directives fail to apply correctly when used alongside another CSS-in-JS solution. The conflict arises from the way each solution manages and applies styles to the DOM. This can result in unexpected styling discrepancies and broken layouts.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`

## Bug Reproduction

Observe the styling inconsistencies within the application. The expected styling, based on Tailwind classes, is not applied consistently due to the clash with another CSS-in-JS solution. This is particularly visible in the layout and elementsâ€™ appearance.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the order and interaction between Tailwind CSS and the other CSS-in-JS library.  One approach is to ensure that Tailwind is applied last to overwrite any conflicting styles. Another approach is to use a CSS-in-JS solution that is compatible with Tailwind. See `bugSolution.js` for implementation details.
