The solution involves using a more compatible CSS-in-JS solution or carefully managing the order of style injection, ensuring Tailwind CSS is applied after any conflicting styles. In this example, we'll modify the CSS-in-JS to ensure Tailwind has the precedence.
```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// ... other code ...

// Modify your CSS-in-JS solution to apply styles after Tailwind.
// This might involve using a higher specificity or a later application point.
const styles = {
  // ... your CSS styles ...
};

//Ensure that the Tailwind styles are applied after styles from the CSS-in-JS library.
//This might involve changing the order of the stylesheets or using a higher specificity in the CSS-in-JS rules.

//Example for applying styles after Tailwind:
//Apply the style at the end
document.body.appendChild(styleSheet);

// ... rest of your code ...
```
